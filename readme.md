# It's The Program

It's The Program scans your Steam purchase history and library playtime and creates a spreadsheet, so you can compare the price you paid (including any discounts!) with the amount of playtime you've gotten.

For Electronic Game Information.

## Security disclaimer

Because this program needs access to your Steam receipts, you'll need to log in and give it full account access. ***Never do this.*** This kind of user-agent login has the potential to give attackers and scammers full access to your Steam account, including your payment infomation and item library, and could do irrevocable damage!

You should only run this program if you're confident that it does not send your information anywhere and does not do anything with it you don't want (the code is short and relatively readable, and it's read-only), but you probably shouldn't do it at all. 

## Usage

Requires firefox. 

Run the program and log in with the selenium browser. It will use your session information and scrape your purchase history, then create a spreadsheet.
